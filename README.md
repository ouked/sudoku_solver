# Sudoku Solver ðŸ§©

An agent to solve sudoku puzzles by approaching them as exact cover problems. This was coursework for my Artificial
Intelligence module at University of Bath. Can solve a "hard" sudoku in under 50 milliseconds on my machine.

## Usage

To obtain a solution, pass `sudoku_solver` a `numpy.ndarray((9,9), ...)`. Examples of input can be found in `/data`.

```python
import numpy as np

sudoku_state = np.ndarray((9, 9), ...)  # Set values to sudoku grid to solve.
solution = sudoku_solver(state=sudoku_state)

print(solution)  # This will print the solution, or a 9x9 grid of '-1'.
```

## Introduction

This was a deeply engaging and educative challenge that I spent a lot of time on. I'm very proud of the results my work
has yielded. Personally, this coursework required two attempts. The first to get my head around backtracking,
constraint-propagation and reducing processing time; the second to approach the problem slightly differently to meet the
sub-one-second target (and re-implement the optimisations).

### First Attempt

My first attempt was a simple backtracking algorithm that would recursively try each of a cell's possible values, and
update the associated cells' possible values accordingly. This was a simple implementation of **backtracking** and
**constraint-propagation**.

The first time this worked it took the agent about **40 seconds** to solve a single "hard" puzzle. I was happy to find
that my code was working, though I wanted to aim to solve a single puzzle in under a second on my machine.

After optimisations including simplifying loops, caching, forward-checking, value frequency analysis and implementing a
specialised `deepcopy` function, I got this time down to about **2 seconds**: a lot closer, but still too slow.

### Second Attempt

I decided to start again, and learnt how to approach sudokus as **exact cover** problems (mainly thanks to Andy G's blog
post [4]). My first implementation of Donald Knuth's Algorithm X [1] resulted in a hard sudoku taking **10 seconds**.
This was worse than my previous _best_, but a lot better than my previous _first_ attempt. Through similar (but fewer)
optimisations (includng the complete removal of deep-copying objects), my submission now takes **less than 50
milliseconds** to solve a "hard" sudoku puzzle.

> the first.

## Exact Covers

### What is an Exact Cover?

An **exact cover** is a collection of subsets of `S` such that every element in `S` is found in _exactly one_ of the
subsets. [2]

#### Example

Given a set `S` and the subsets `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`:

- `S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`


- `A = {1, 6, 7}`

- `B = {1, 3, 5}`

- `C = {2}`

- `D = {3, 4, 5}`

- `E = {1, 2, 3, 4}`

Then the exact cover of `S` is the sets `A`, `C`, `D`:

- ```A âˆª C âˆª D = S``` (The subsets cover _every_ element in `S`)


- ```A âˆ© C âˆ© D = {}``` (Every element in `S` is covered by _only one_ set)

### Solving Exact Cover Problems with Donald Knuth's Algorithm X

Before we discuss how we solve sudokus specifically, let's explore how to solve a _general_ exact cover problem.

**Algorithm X** solves exact cover problems by using a matrix `A`, consisting of 1s and 0s. Let's put the above example
such a matrix.

|     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| B   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| C   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| D   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| E   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The algorithm is as follows:

```
If A is empty, the problem is solved; terminate successfully.

Otherwise choose a column, c (deterministically).
Choose a row, r, such that A[r, c] = 1 (nondeterministically).

Include r in the partial solution.

For each j such that A[r, j] = 1, 
    delete column j from matrix A; 
    
    for each i such that A[i, j] = 1,
        delete row i from matrix A.
        
Repeat this algorithm recursively on the reduced matrix A.
```

> Taken from **page 4** of
> [Knuth's "Dancing Links" paper](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jchu/publicportal/sudoku/0011047.pdf) [1]

In simpler terms, the algorithm takes an element `e` to cover, and finds a row which does so. This row is added to the
solution, and every row that also covers `e` is removed from `A`, along with every column that the chosen row also
satisfies.

Selecting row `A`, and doing this described reduction leads to the reduced matrix `A`:

|     | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| C   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| D   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

`Solution = {A}`

- Row `A` was removed and **added to our solution**.
- Rows `B` and `E` were removed because they also covered element `1`.
- Columns `1`, `6`, `7` were removed because they were covered by row `A`.

You can see how doing the same steps again will reduce this matrix further, and will lead to a valid solution being
found.

### Sudoku as an Exact Cover Problem

To approach sudoku as an exact cover problem, you must step back from the sudoku grid, and think about what a solved
sudoku contains:

- A set of **filled cells**
- A set of **rows**, each with one of each number `1-9`
- A set of **columns**, each with one of each number `1-9`
- A set of **blocks**, each with one of each number `1-9`

... and we can also think about what it means to write a value `v` to a cell `(row, column)` in the sudoku grid:

- This unique RCV (Row, Column, Value) will help to satisfy a unique combination of the constraints listed above.

- No other cell in the grid should satisfy the same constraints, as this would mean there were duplicate values. (i.e
  The constraint "Row 1 should contain the value 5" should only be satisfied once).

- ... so every constraint needs to be satisfied by exactly one RCV triple.

This is now an exact cover problem - **every element in our set of constraints needs to be covered exactly once**!

From what we've realised from the nature of sudoku puzzles, we can construct our matrix `A` to represent our constraints
and associated RCV combinations. The following is a few rows and columns from the expansive matrix:

|      Constraints     | 0,0,1 | 0,0,2 |   | 4,4,1 |
|----------------------|-------|-------|---|-------|
| Cell 0,0 has a value | 1     | 0     |   |   0   |
| Cell 0,1 has a value | 1     | 0     |   |   0   |
||
| Row 0 contains a 1   | 1     | 0     |   |   0   |
| Row 0 contains a 2   | 0     | 1     |   |   0   |
||
| Col 0 contains a 1   | 1     | 0     |   |   0   |
| Col 0 contains a 2   | 0     | 1     |   |   0   |
||
| Block 4 contains a 1 | 0     | 0     |   |   1   |

Now that we have our matrix `A`, we can apply Algorithm X to generate solutions.

> **Note**: I learnt a majority of this from Andy G.'s excellent explanation
[here](https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/solving-sudoku-revisited/) [4].

## My Implementation of Algorithm X

> **Note:** Due to python naming conventions, the matrix `A` is referred to as `a` throughout my code.

After `sudoku_solver` is passed the initial state, it passes it to `backtrack`, which is the main worker function. This
is where Algorithm X is executed.

`pick_constraint` will find the constraint with the smallest number of satisfying RCV tuples, which relate to rows in
matrix `A`. These rows are tried in term, just as described before.

### Backtracking

Algorithm X is a backtracking function - it exploits the nature of recursing (and "un-recursing") to find the correct
solution.

You can see the backtracking function here:

```python
def backtrack(state: SudokuState) -> SudokuState or None:
    """
    Solve sudoku using backtracking
    :param state: State to solve
    :return: Solved state
    """
    # Pick a column
    pick = state.pick_constraint()

    # No more constraints to satisfy
    if pick is None:
        return None

    const, rows = pick
    values = list(rows)

    for rcv in values:
        # Using select_row and deselect_row means that we don't need to make (deep) copies of the state, which are
        # expensive.

        # Select the row, get and remove the associated columns
        columns = state.select_row(rcv)
        # Add rcv of row to solutions
        state.add_solution(rcv)

        # Return this state if it's correct
        if state.is_goal():
            return state

        # Continue working on this state
        deep_state = backtrack(state)
        if deep_state is not None and deep_state.is_goal():
            return deep_state

        # Deselect and remove rcv from solution, so that we can try the next rcv
        state.deselect_row(rcv, columns)
        state.remove_solution(rcv)
```

As the first series of rows that are tried will likely **not** be the solution, eventually the algorithm will backtrack,
and any changes made to the `SudokuState` object will need to be abandoned.

Initially this was achieved by creating a deep copy of the `SudokuState` object at each level of the recursion, creating
independent copies of mutable fields (namely `A`). However, creating these copies was inefficient and slowed the
algorithm down significantly.

After attempting to fix this by writing a new, specialised, and therefore faster `deepcopy`
function, I decided it would be better to use the same object, and instead store changes to the matrix in the
appropriate recursion level in a `list` named `columns`. As the algorithm works back up the recursion levels, it will
undo these changes, restoring the matrix back to how it was for the level above it.

### Constraint Propagation

The act of removing rows and columns after a row is selected is a strict and efficient way of propagating constraints.

## Optimisations

> **Note:** Not all the following are in my final solution.

### Caching

Before using Algorithm X, I decreased the processing time significantly by caching rows, column and blocks that had
already been validated in a shared dictionary for all puzzles. Rows, columns and blocks can all be considered
equivalent, as they all require one of each value `1-9`, regardless of order. Blocks were flattened to make them
equivalent to rows and columns.

Part of the success of this optimisation was the fact that the algorithm would spend slightly longer on the faster
puzzles (those classed as "very_easy", "easy", or "medium") to speed up the processing of the slower puzzles.

It was faster to store the permutations (where order matters) instead of the combinations (where order doesn't matter),
so the algorithm would generate 24806 permutations from the testing data, compared to the 520 possible combinations.
This obviously increased space complexity of the algorithm dramatically, but processing time was my main priority.

Now that the code uses Algorithm X, there is no need to check for valid combinations of numbers, so there currently is
no caching.

### Specialised `deepcopy` method

Profiling my code uncovered the fact that `deepcopy` was taking up the most processing time, so I needed to reduce the
time it took.

As the `copy.deepcopy` function is made to make an independent copy of an **arbitrary** object, it will be doing a lot
of unnecessary processing in most cases. Looking at the source code in `copy.py` shows the amount of checks that occur
everytime a copy is made. These checks would be necessary if the object I was copying contained references to itself [5]
, however in this particular case, it doesn't.

Writing a new `deepcopy` method was as simple as creating a new object of the same class, and setting the fields to the
values of the copied object.

Here is what the specialised `deepcopy` looked like.

```python
def __deepcopy__(self, memodict={}):
    """
    Perform a deepcopy on SudokuState.
    IMPORTANT: New fields added to the class SudokuState also need to be added here.
    :return: New object
    """

    cls = self.__class__
    state = cls.__new__(cls)
    state.values = self.values
    state.a = {k: set(self.a[k]) for k in self.a.keys()}  # set() is quicker than copy()
    state.solvable = self.solvable
    state.solution = self.solution
    return state
```

> **Note**: This is a precise, fast and error-prone way of copying an object. This approach requires you to update
> `deepcopy` everytime a new field is added to the class that is being copied.


This was being used for a while in my second attempt, though now it uses the `select_row`,  `deselect_row`,
`add_solution` and `remove_solution` functions to make and abandon changes made to the same object through the
recursions.

### Selecting and Deselecting Rows

Instead of making a whole copy of an object just to change a few values in the huge matrix, it is much faster to use the
same object throughout the algorithm and keep track of the changes that you have made, and then reverting these changes
before returning.

### Removed Enums

To reduce bugs and improve readability, I was using enums for constraints. This meant that typos would be instantly
recognised. However, using strings is much faster.

After researching online, I found that Python's slow enums have been discussed, and were at one point 20x slower than
normal lookups (Python 3.4) [6]. This has been fixed, though there is still an open issue on the python bug tracker
complaining about the speed for Python 3.9. [7]

I converted all enums to strings at the end of development of my second attempt.

## Learning Outcomes

- Depth-First Search, Constraint Propagation and Forward Checking

- Exact Cover Problems and Knuth's Algorithm X

- Implementing Previously-Theoretical Ideas

- Python's Enums are Slow

- How to Spell "Sudoku"

## Future Development

Early attempts at this project included functionality to solve sudokus that weren't the standard 9x9 grid. As this
feature would be untested, and most likely riddled with bugs, I decided that for my final submission I should submit
code with the 9x9 grid assumed and expected throughout.

I believe it would be a good exercise to re-implement the lost generality: perhaps I could aim to solve **16x16 
hexadecimal sudokus**, such as this one:
